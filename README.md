# Davis-Sunflowers-Su21

Project goals:
Plants influence their reproduction and mating system in many ways. Various factors
such as time of flowering, ability to attract pollinators, the position of their anthers and
stigmas, timing of anthers opening and pollen dispersal, and receptivity of stigmas. All of
these processes lead to diversity in the reproduction system in angiosperms. The current
project addresses the questions of how sunflowers have evolved to optimize outcrossing
or cross-pollination. Outcrossing is essential for hybrid seed production in crops, hence
helpful to breeders and the seed industry.
Currently, we are investigating how internal and external factors influence outcrossing
via protandry in wild sunflowers. Protandry is a strategy to improve outcrossing by
temporal (time) separation of male and female flower development phases. Sunfllowers
depends heavily on insects for pollination. We use genomic and quantitative genetic
approaches to understand better how the precise timing of floral development promotes
cross-pollination.

Materials/Methods
In Summer 2021, we plan to grow segregating progeny of a cross between two populations
(Manitoba and Kansas) collections at UC Davis field experiment station. At anthesis, we
set up time-lapse cameras to capture events of floral maturation- bud break, pollen
release and stigma curling. The tissue will also be collected to extract DNA from each
plant and genotyped by sequencing to map the genetic loci of the traits.
We will use MBxKS- F4 and F5 progeny seeds. Generally, wild sunflowers (Helianthus
annuus) seeds are small in size and possess both seed coat dormancy and
physiological dormancy. Sometimes, seeds harbor endogenous pathogens that could
affect the germination and survival. We plan to test various scarification and seed
germination methods including hormones and plant protection chemicals to improve the
seed germination. The number of seeds obtained per cross would also be a limitation
due to poor seed set on the plants, so we need to use seeds sparingly. Survival of
transplants into buckets in the field is sometimes minimal, so plan to grow healthy and
vigourous seedlings for transplanting. We plan to phenotype atleast 10 plants per
progeny of F4 generation and atleast 5 plants of F5 generation.
As the Wingscape trial cameras are limited in number (~60), we plan to grow plants in
batches. So, we will germinate seeds in batches.
We will collect plant samples for DNA extraction and perform Genotype by sequencing
to map the underlying loci.
